# OOP-4-Pricinples-Basics

There are 3 classes that inherit from each other . -->inheritance
Employee is the superclass, that only has the basic attributes.
All are protected so can the be only be accessed by getter/setter methods --> getAge() -->encapsulation
The work function is different for eacg type of employee --> polymorphism
The askForPromotion method is apparently simple, but in reality it checks two conditions in order to modify an attribute --> abstraction.
